# LsapSolver: Solving the Linear sum assignment problem (LSAP)

**LsapSolver** is a software application specifically designed to solve the **Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP)**.

## Key Features

1. **Efficient LSAP Solving:**
   - Quickly solves LSAP instances, with small problems yielding results in seconds.
   - Handles larger instances efficiently.
   - Automatically terminates when system memory is low.
2. **Customizable Solutions:**
   - Allows you to maximize or minimize solutions based on input data (costs or profits).
   - Easily enable maximize mode with a checkbox.
3. **Detailed Results Export:**
   - Save optimized assignments to an Excel workbook.
   - Obtain detailed solution information for analysis.
4. **Heuristics for Improved Performance:**
   - LsapSolver uses heuristics to find a good initial solution (warm start).
   - This significantly enhances the performance of the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver.
5. **Flexible Matrix Size:**
   - Load cost matrices in Excel format.
   - Supports matrix sizes up to 350x350 entries.
6. **Fine-Tune Solver Parameters:**
   - Adjust the solver timeout to suit your needs.
